# Projet Ehura

## Task

 Build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Youâ€™ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

 This is what I have done, and given it a delightful name. This was complete with Sequelize, MySQL2, dotenv.


## Usage

 - Clone the [repository](https://github.com/omgthegreenranger/project-ehura)
 - `npm install`
 - import the `./db/schema.sql` in to your MySQL database
 - `npm start`, stop server, `npm run seed`.
 - run server again
 - fire up a REST client such as Insomnia
 - send some stuff!

## Further details

The project name is a bit of a stretch, but the Communications Officer on the Enterprise 1701 was Lieutenant Uhura, and this is an e-commerce site, so _e_hura, get it?
